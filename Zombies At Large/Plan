Consider increasing quality of service (QoS) on an operation queue to increase hud loading


Changed the child-entity relationship attribute in a to-many relationship such that the parent entity changed from optional to required....migration could not be be accomplished, Core Data gives error...can first delete all the child entities whose relationship attribute is nil, or provide a default value for the attribute by looping through the results of a fetchRequest and then called delete on the managed object context, or assigning a value to the nil attribute and the calling save on the managed object context...then the migration will work

Use update function or other game loop function - check that safety zone contains the player or rescue characters;  don't use contact logic

Use Hongbao for money units (instead of coins or monetary value)
Use kuai/yuan for monetary units
Use rice bowls for energy level

Each level has a compass point that must be obtained in order to complete it
Save Sun Wu Kong
Sava Pandas
Use Firecrackers as explosives
Missing Characters - spell a word

Continue to develop UIElements for Game Win, Game Loss, and Other Situations

Make sure that zombies can collide with each other so that they don't overlap
Instead of looping thru all zombies, try using collision detection to activate them

For one mission, have camera slowly animate to position to show a couple in distress, then animate back to the player

use camera to animate back and forth between different players

Use an activity indicator or a progress bar to indicate that the game is loading; progress units/progress count can be incremented in the didMoveToViewFunction, with the activity indicator or progress bar being updated accordingly; the progress bar or activity indicataor will be a property of the game view controller

Watch out: player can accidentally hit restart level button, be sure to ask for a confirmation in case the user hits it by accident; maybe provide options "Quit", "Save and Quit", "Cancel"

Update the hud by calling update functions on shared manager from within the player class
